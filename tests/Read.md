Checklist

Enumerate models and forms and map each field to a DataGenerator method (text, int, email, url, datetime, json).
Generate valid tuples for each field, normalize lengths, then assemble lists of dicts for each model/form payload.
Handle FK/relations by generating integer IDs and arrays (M2M) using DataGenerator, documenting that they are placeholders.
Ensure uniqueness where appropriate (emails, names, IDs) via DataGenerator ensure_unique or simple de-dup logic.
Save each fixture using DataGenerator.save_fixture with both valid and invalid entries.
Provide a single entry point to produce fixtures for all models and forms.

Data generator: tests.generate_fixtures.DataGenerator
Users models: config.users.models.User, config.users.models.PartnerProfile
Parser models: config.parser.models.TelegramChannel, config.parser.models.ChannelModerator, config.parser.models.ChannelStats
Group channels model: config.group_channels.models.Group
Users forms: config.users.forms.UserLoginForm, config.users.forms.UserRegForm, config.users.forms.UserUpdateForm, config.users.forms.AvatarChange, config.users.forms.RestorePasswordRequestForm, config.users.forms.RestorePasswordForm

Group channels forms: config.group_channels.forms.CreateGroupForm, config.group_channels.forms.UpdateGroupForm, config.group_channels.forms.AddChannelForm
Issues and Assumptions

Fixture target format: Assumed simple JSON with {"valid": [...], "invalid": [...]} saved via DataGenerator.save_fixture, consistent with generate_fixtures.py.
Quantity: Assumed to use DataGenerator.data_size (defaults to NUM_OF_FIXTURES) for count.
Foreign keys and M2M: Assumed to be represented by placeholder integer IDs and integer lists (not actual DB-resolved IDs). Unique pairs (ChannelModerator) are not strictly enforced beyond basic de-dup logic.
Field constraints not fully specified:
config.group_channels.models.Group.image_url lacks max_length; assumed URL-like strings via DataGenerator.generate_urls.
config.users.models.User.role field exists, but also a property role shadows it; assumed fixtures include a simple text value for role.
Form vs model constraints mismatch (e.g., CreateGroupForm.name max_length=150 vs Group.name max_length=50); assumed form fixtures use the stricter model max where mismatched.
Validation: Only DataGenerator’s built-in validators (URL/email/datetime/JSON) are applied; no custom Django form or model validation is executed.
Password fields: Assumed to populate password pairs with identical generated strings for confirmation fields.
Self‑reflection

All models and forms from the provided files are covered, with fixtures saved via the shared DataGenerator.save_fixture API and generation relying only on DataGenerator methods.
Ambiguities around FK representation, field limits, and validation are documented; next step would be to align fixture schemas with any loader/importer expectations if these will be loaded into a DB.

They’re intentionally imported for clarity and tooling, not for runtime use.

They document which models/forms the generator targets, so readers and IDEs can navigate to definitions: config.users.models.User, config.users.models.PartnerProfile, config.parser.models.TelegramChannel, config.parser.models.ChannelModerator, config.parser.models.ChannelStats, config.group_channels.models.Group; forms: config.users.forms.UserLoginForm, config.users.forms.UserRegForm, config.users.forms.UserUpdateForm, config.users.forms.AvatarChange, config.users.forms.RestorePasswordRequestForm, config.users.forms.RestorePasswordForm, config.parser.forms.ChannelParseForm, config.group_channels.forms.CreateGroupForm, config.group_channels.forms.UpdateGroupForm, config.group_channels.forms.AddChannelForm.
The spec was to generate fixtures “using only the DataGenerator,” so the code avoids introspecting Django models/forms and instead builds payloads directly.
The comments and noqa flags (e.g., F401) in generate_fixtures.py explicitly suppress “unused import” warnings to keep the file self‑documenting.
If you prefer, these imports can be removed with no functional change, or replaced by lightweight type-only imports/comments.
